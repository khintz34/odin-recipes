                <h2>Description</h2> 
                <p>My grandmother's recipe for roasted chicken. We are German and she used to do it this way all the time. I never have had a chicken this juicy before;
                    this little trick works and makes the people eating it go silent. It's funny. We nibble on the celery after.

                 <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
                <li>Place chicken in a roasting pan, and season generously inside and out with salt and pepper. Sprinkle inside and out with onion powder. Place 3 tablespoons margarine in the chicken cavity.
                     Arrange dollops of the remaining margarine around the chicken's exterior. Cut the celery into 3 or 4 pieces, and place in the chicken cavity.</li>
                <li>Bake uncovered 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven, to a minimum internal temperature of 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove from heat, and baste with melted margarine and drippings.
